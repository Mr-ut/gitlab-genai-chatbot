## üõ† Technical Approach and Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

**1. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Choice**

- **Decision**: Implemented RAG instead of fine-tuning
- **Rationale**: RAG provides up-to-date information, better transparency, and lower computational costs
- **Implementation**: ChromaDB for vector storage + LangChain for orchestration

**2. Technology Stack Selection**

**Backend: FastAPI + Python**

- **Why**: High performance, excellent async support, automatic API documentation
- **Benefits**: Easy testing, dependency injection, Pydantic validation

**Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind**

- **Why**: Modern, performant, type-safe with excellent developer experience
- **Benefits**: Component reusability, responsive design, accessibility

**Vector Database: ChromaDB**

- **Why**: Easy local deployment, good performance, Python integration
- **Benefits**: No external dependencies, persistent storage, similarity search

**3. Data Processing Pipeline**

**Asynchronous Scraping**

```python
async def scrape_all(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        for base_url in self.base_urls:
            await self._scrape_site_section(session, base_url)
```

**Intelligent Chunking**

- 1000 character chunks with 200 character overlap
- Preserves document structure and context
- Maintains source attribution

### Key Technical Innovations

**1. Smart Content Filtering**

```python
def _is_relevant_link(self, url: str, base_url: str) -> bool:
    # Domain validation, path filtering, file type exclusion
    # Ensures only relevant GitLab content is scraped
```

**2. Contextual Response Generation**

```python
def _build_context(self, relevant_docs: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> str:
    # Creates structured context from retrieved documents
    # Includes source attribution and relevance scoring
```

**3. Graceful Degradation**

```python
def _get_mock_response(self, message: str, context: str) -> str:
    # Provides helpful responses even without LLM API keys
    # Maintains functionality for demo purposes
```

## üí° Creative and Advanced Features

### 1. Intelligent Guardrails

**Input Validation**

- Message length limits (1-1000 characters)
- Content filtering for appropriate queries
- Rate limiting (60 requests/minute)

**Response Safety**

- Source attribution for all claims
- Confidence scoring for retrieved documents
- Transparent limitations disclosure

### 2. Enhanced User Experience

**Guided Onboarding**

```typescript
const exampleQuestions = [
  "What is GitLab's remote work policy?",
  'How does GitLab handle code reviews?',
  "What are GitLab's company values?",
  // ... more examples
];
```

**Progressive Disclosure**

- Welcome screen with example questions
- Source cards showing relevance scores
- Clear error messages and recovery options

**Visual Hierarchy**

- Color-coded source types (Handbook vs Direction)

## üèó Code Quality and Best Practices

### Backend Code Quality

**Dependency Injection**

```python
# Singleton pattern for services
chat_service = ChatService()
vector_store_service = VectorStoreService()
```

**Error Handling**

```python
try:
    result = await chat_service.chat(...)
    return ChatResponse(**result)
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Chat error: {e}")
    raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="...")
```

**Configuration Management**

```python
class Settings(BaseSettings):
    # Environment-based configuration
    # Type validation with Pydantic
    # Secure defaults
```

### Frontend Code Quality

**TypeScript Integration**

```typescript
interface ChatResponse {
  response: string;
  conversation_id: string;
  sources: Source[];
  metadata: ResponseMetadata;
}
```

**React Best Practices**

```typescript
// Custom hooks for logic separation
const chatMutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: chatService.sendMessage,
  onSuccess: handleSuccess,
  onError: handleError,
});
```

**Component Architecture**

- Single responsibility principle
- Reusable UI components
- Props interface definitions
- Error boundary implementation

### Testing Strategy

**Backend Tests**

```python
def test_chat_endpoint_valid_message():
    response = client.post("/api/v1/chat", json={
        "message": "What is GitLab?"
    })
    assert response.status_code == 200
    # ... comprehensive assertions
```

**Frontend Tests**

- Component unit tests
- User interaction testing
